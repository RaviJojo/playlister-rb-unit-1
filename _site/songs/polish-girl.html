    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>It's been at least another year<br>And still I haven't got the chance to say<br>Always rolling off the tongue<br>Never said but nearly sung about a million ways<br><br>Every photograph and story<br>Trickled through the lengthy web of friends<br>I overthought but understood<br>Distant look but looking good<br>And not the other way<br><br>But you fail to remember<br>But you fail to remember<br><br>Do I still cross your mind?<br>Your face still distorts the time<br><br>Do I still cross your mind?<br>Your face still distorts the time<br><br>With heat struck afternoons long through<br>Those idle dreams go back to you<br>Was this only in my head<br>Just like most things go misread<br>When overthought </p>

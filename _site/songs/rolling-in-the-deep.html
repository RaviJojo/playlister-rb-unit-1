    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>There's a fire starting in my heart*<br>Reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark<br>Finally I can see you crystal clear<br>Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship there<br>See how I leave with every piece of you<br>Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br>There's a fire starting in my heart<br>Reaching a fever pitch<br>And it's bring me out the dark<br>The scars of your love remind me of us<br>They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>The scars of your love they leave me breathless<br>I can't help feeling<br>We could have had it all<br>Rolling in the deep<br>You had my heart and soul inside of your hand<br>And you played it<br>To the beat<br>Baby I have no story to be told<br>But I've heard one of you<br>And I'm gonna make your head burn<br>Think of me in the depths of your despair<br>Making a home down there<br>It Reminds you of the home we shared<br>The scars of your love remind me of us<br>They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br>The scars of your love they leave me breathless<br>I can't help feeling<br>We could have had it all<br>Rolling in the deep<br>You had my heart and soul<br>And you played it<br>To the beat<br>Throw your soul through every open door<br>Count your blessings to find what you look for<br>Turned my sorrow into treasured gold<br>You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow<br>We could have had it all<br>We could have had it all<br>It all, it all it all,<br>We could have had it all<br>Rolling in the deep<br>You had my heart and soul<br>And you played it<br>To the beat</p>

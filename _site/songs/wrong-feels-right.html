    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Tell me what you dream while you are fast asleep<br>Could it be of me?<br>I cannot breath, this tightness just won't leave<br>My heart is gonna heave<br>I wish that you could see me<br>Dream away the realness of the day<br>Dream away the reasons I can stay<br>I need my fix<br>Cause you fix me right now<br>When nothing else is enough<br>Nothing else is enough<br>I sing for you<br>I know you know it too<br>There's nothing else to do<br>Nothing else to do<br>Dream away the realness of the day<br>Dream away the reasons I can stay<br>It happened over night<br>It's wrong but it feels right<br>It happened over night<br>It's wrong but it feels right<br>Dream away the realness of the day<br>Dream away the reasons I can stay<br>It happened over night<br>It's wrong but it feels right<br>It happened over night<br>It's wrong but it feels right</p>

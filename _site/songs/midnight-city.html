    <p>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>The night city crawls<br>Look and see the right to it<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>Drinking in the lounge<br>Following the neon signs<br>Waiting for a ride<br>Looking at a milky skyline<br>City is my church<br>We're rushing in this twilight<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark<br>Waiting in a car<br>Waiting for a ride in the dark</p>

    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>[Hook: Frank Ocean]<br>Human beings in a mob<br>What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a God?<br>What's a God to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?<br>Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild<br><br>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]<br>Tears on the mausoleum floor<br>Blood stains the Colosseum doors<br>Lies on the lips of a priest<br>Thanksgiving disguised as a feast<br>Rolling in Rolls Royce Corniche<br>Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police<br>Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached<br>Drug dealer chic, I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach<br>Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?<br>Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?<br>All for Plato, screech<br>I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks<br>Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats<br>Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach<br><br>[Hook]<br><br>[Bridge: The-Dream]<br>I live by you, desire<br>I stand by you, walk through the fire<br>Your love is my scripture<br>Let me into your encryption<br><br>[Verse 2: Kanye West]<br>Coke on her black skin<br>Made a stripe like a zebra, I call that jungle fever<br>You will not control the threesome<br>Just roll the weed up until I get me some<br>We formed a new religion<br>No sins as long as there’s permission<br>And deception is the only felony<br>So never fuck nobody without telling me<br>Sunglasses and Advil, last night was mad real<br>Sun coming up, 5 a.m., I wonder if they got cabs still?<br>Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard<br>Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepherd<br>Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"<br>The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"<br>It’s something that the pastor don’t preach<br>It’s something that a teacher can’t teach<br>When we die the money we can’t keep<br>But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap: preach<br><br>[Hook]</p>

    <p>I got big balls, big old balls<br>Big as grapefruits, big as pumpkins<br>Yes sir, yes sir, and on my really good days<br>They swell to the size of small dogs<br>My balls are as big as small dogs<br><br>Well, it ain't braggin' if it's true<br>Yes sir, yes sir, it ain't braggin' if it's true<br>Muhammad Ali said that<br>Back when he was a young man<br>Back when he was cassius clay<br>Before he fought too many fights<br>And left his brain inside the ring<br><br>And sometimes I wish I was Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods<br>Sometimes I wish I was Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods<br><br>I got a friend whose goal in life<br>Was to one day go down on Madonna<br>That's all he wanted, that was all<br>To one day go down on Madonna<br><br>And when my friend was thirty-four<br>He got his wish in Rome one night<br>He got to go down on Madonna<br>In Rome one night in some hotel<br><br>And ever since he's been depressed<br>'Cause life is shit from here on in<br>And all our friends just shake their heads<br>And say too soon, too soon, too soon<br>He went down on Madonna too soon<br>Too young, too young, too soon, too soon<br><br>And it ain't braggin' if it's true<br>Yes sir, yes sir, it ain't braggin' if it's true<br>Muhammad Ali said that<br>Back when he was cassius clay<br>Before he fought too many fights<br>And left his brain inside the ring<br><br>And sometimes I wish I was Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods<br>Sometimes I wish I was Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods<br><br>If certain girls don't look at you<br>It means that they like you a lot<br>If other girls don't look at you<br>It just means they're ignoring you<br><br>How can you know, how can you know<br>Which is which, who's doin' what<br>I guess that you can ask 'em<br>Which one are you, baby?<br><br>Do you like me or are you ignoring me?<br>Do you like me or are you ignoring me?<br>Do you like me or are you ignoring me?<br><br>And all you need to do that is one big pair of big balls<br>Balls as big as grapefruits, balls as big as pumpkins<br>Balls as big as mine but even though my balls are big<br>Sometimes I wish they were bigger, even bigger<br><br>Big as the wheels on a tractor<br>Big as the golden arches<br>Big as the golden gate bridge<br>Big as the state of Kansas<br>Big as Mars and Jupiter<br>Big as the swing of Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods<br>Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods</p>

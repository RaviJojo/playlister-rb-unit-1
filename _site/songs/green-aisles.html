    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Under dormant trees, under bright lit skies<br>Mountains of maple leaves standing side by side<br>The fog lights, the street lights lead me to you<br>And if you just sit tight I'll be there soon<br>All those wasted miles<br>All those aimless drives through green aisles<br>Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise, no<br>I rode right pass the train tracks on ancient as the stone<br>Blacked out on a bicycle I made my way back home<br>The houses were humming all through the night<br>The winter was coming but that was alright<br>All those wasted miles<br>All those aimless drives through green aisles<br>Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise, no<br>The fog lights, the street lights lead me to you<br>And if you just sit tight, I'll be there soon<br>All those wasted miles<br>All those aimless drives through green aisles<br>Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise, no<br>All those wasted miles<br>All those aimless drives through green aisles<br>Our careless lifestyle, it was not so unwise, no</p>

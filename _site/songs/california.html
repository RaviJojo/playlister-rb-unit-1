    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>F*ck California, you made me boring*<br>I've bled all my blood out<br>But these red pants they don't show that<br>My old friends though they know that<br>But when I sold them I sold that<br>I'm sorry Gracie Grewie Golden...<br>I'm sorry Steven and Andrew that I ever left you<br>You never seen the ocean, you never been on a plane<br>Schizophrenic rules the brain<br>And it's coming to take you away<br>You're still my favorite past life martyred saint<br>Give me the places, I'll give you the names<br>Wasted away alone on the planes<br>What's it like to be small time and gay?<br>F*ck it baby, I know you'll never change<br>So hold me down<br>But I got in<br>Quick hit to the face<br>Soft blow to the mouth<br>On Christmas morning<br>You're bleeding from the fingertips<br>You rubbed me raw, you rubbed me wrong<br>And I hear you and I think of you<br>Oh California<br>Now you've corrupted us all with your sexuality<br>Tried to tell me love was free<br>Tried to tell me love was free<br>I said them? Maybe you you you you you and me<br>Oh love in the time of scandal<br>Love in the form of tragedy<br>Love so much, so real, so f*cked<br>It's 51-50<br>But I'm just 22,<br>I'm just 22,<br>I don't mind dying<br>I don't mind dying<br>I don't mind<br>What does failure taste like?<br>To me it tastes like dirt<br>I'm begging you please to look away<br>I bet my money on the Bob Tail Man<br>Somebody bet on the bet<br>I saw Joseph carrying the gun<br>I saw Mary carrying the gun<br>The gun, the gun, the gun<br>The gun, carrying the gun<br>I saw Grandpa carrying the gun<br>I saw Grandma carrying the gun<br>The gun, the gun, the gun<br>The gun, carrying the gun<br>I used to carry the gun<br>I used to carry the gun<br>The gun, the gun, the gun<br>The gun, carrying the gun</p>

    <p>Don't try to fight<br>It's now your fall<br>Let go, reach out,<br>The choice is yours to fight<br><br>Inside, you've got<br>The light to guide,<br>Your fate desires<br>The roads you're going to find.<br><br>Relax, slow down<br>Let hope decide.<br>Even though it gets hard to forget<br>When you can't afford enough<br>Trusting all your thought<br>You know you'll be alright in time.<br><br>Inside, you've got<br>The light to guide<br>Your fate decides<br>The roads you're going<br>To find.<br><br>Inside, you've got<br>The light to guide<br>Your fate decides<br>The roads you're going,<br>To find.</p>

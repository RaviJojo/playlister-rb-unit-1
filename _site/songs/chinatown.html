    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>You can't believe the way the wind's talking to the sea. I heard that someone said it before. I don't care, I can't walk away. I can't walk away in Chinatown.<br>The wind and the rain to your detriment you try to explain a government swallowed up in the squall. I can't walk away at all in Chinatown.<br>I stare at the sky so I know which way that I drink my wine from a porcelain cup. I fall down.<br>You can't believe though I'm sure somebody said it before. I know you and I know the score. I can't walk away. You can't walk away.</p>

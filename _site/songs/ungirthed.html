    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>The scent of my hands is familiar<br>To prostrated men in their call<br>To gargle on their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire<br>Who speak with so tenderly<br>Who speak with, so tenderly coax<br><br>The tinge of my eyes is familiar<br>To prostrated men in their call<br>To get close, close, close<br>To their closetly homes<br>Illuminate the words of the ghosts<br><br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears, ears<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears, ears ring<br><br>The air is familiar<br>So is that smell<br>Dead voices cover their mouths<br>Refill their quotas<br>With vessels of earth<br>And cry in detritioning bones<br><br>Dust off my necklace, familiar<br>To culminated piles,<br>To the culminated piles of bones<br>That shift when the earth quakes<br>It trembles, trembles<br>And call these men up to their,<br>And call these men up to their thrones<br><br>The scent of my skin is familiar<br>To prostrated men in their call<br>To gargle on their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire<br>Who speak with so tenderly<br>Who speak with so tenderly, coax<br><br>The air is familiar<br>So is that smell<br>Dead voices cover their mouths<br>And refill their quotas<br>With vessels of earth<br>(?)<br><br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ringing, teeth clicking<br>Ears ears ring</p>

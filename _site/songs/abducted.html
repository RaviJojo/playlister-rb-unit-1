    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>I knew right then that I'd been abducted*<br>I knew right then that he would be taking my heart<br>I knew right then no one was above him<br>I knew right then that he would be breaking my heart<br>He tore me apart because I really loved him<br>He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out<br>He broke my heart because I really loved him<br>He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out<br>I knew right then that she'd been abducted<br>I knew right then that I would be taking her heart<br>I knew right then that I'd never love her<br>The reasons I hope the dream hasn't left her scarred<br>He tore me apart because I really loved him<br>He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out<br>He broke my heart because I really loved him<br>He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out<br>He tore me apart because I really loved him<br>He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out<br>He broke my heart because I really loved him<br>He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out </p>

    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Ah, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah<br>I'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no, I'm not<br>Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops<br>Reptar, rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars<br>Wearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks<br>Bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone<br>Makin' crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones<br>This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown<br>About 5-7 of his bitches in my bedroom<br>Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sinnin' shit<br>While Syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men<br>Syd, shut the fuck up<br>Here's the number to my therapist<br>Tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'<br>Ah, Wolf Haley, ah Golf Wang<br>Ah, Wolf Haley, ah Golf Wang<br>Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses<br>I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline<br>For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine<br>And he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time<br>I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal<br>This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nine<br>This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine<br>But after bowlin', I went home to some damn Adventure Time<br>What'd you do?<br>I slipped myself some pink Zannies<br>And danced around the house in all-over print panties<br>My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me<br>I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin<br>What you think of Hayley Williams?<br>Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' 'em<br>I'll crash that fuckin' airplane at that faggot nigga B.o.B is in<br>And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus<br>And won't stop until the cops come in<br>I'm an over achiever, so how 'bout I start a team of leaders<br>And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver<br>Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant gold retrievers<br>All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need 'em<br>But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em<br>In some cookin' books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em<br>Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves<br>It's been a couple months<br>And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave, damn<br>Ah, Wolf Haley, ah Golf Wang<br>Ah, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah<br>Goddamn Goblin<br>Wolf Haley, ah, Golf Wang<br>Ah Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah<br>They say success is the best revenge<br>So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in<br>Oh, not again, another critic writin' report<br>I'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork<br>Still suicidal? I am<br>I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand<br>I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head<br>And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch<br>What the fuck, man?<br>Fuck the fame and all the hype, G<br>I just wanna know if my father would ever like me<br>But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me<br>A motherfuckin' goblin<br>Fuck everythin', man<br>That's what my conscience said<br>Then the bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead<br>Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement<br>Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead</p>

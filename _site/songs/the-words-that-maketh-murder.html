    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>I've seen and done things I want to forget<br>I've seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat<br>Blown and shot out beyond belief<br>Arms and legs were in the trees<br>I've seen and done things I want to forget<br>Coming from an unearthly place<br>Longing to see a woman's face<br>Instead of the words that gather pace<br>The words that maketh murder<br>These, these, these are the words<br>The words that maketh murder<br>These, these, these are the words<br>The words that maketh murder<br>These, these, these are the words<br>The words that maketh murder<br>These, these, these are the words, murder<br>These, these, these are the words<br>The words that maketh murder<br>These, these, these are the words<br>The words that maketh murder<br>I've seen and done things I want to forget<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>(The words that maketh murder)<br>I've seen a corporal whose nerves were shot<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>(The words that maketh murder)<br>Climbing behind the fierce, gone sun<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>(The words that maketh murder)<br>I've seen flies swarming everyone<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>(The words that maketh murder)<br>Soldiers fell like lumps of meat<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>(The words that maketh murder)<br>These are the words, the words are these<br>  (These, these, these are the words)<br>Death lingering stunk<br>Flies swarming everyone<br>Over the whole summit peak<br>Flesh quivering in the heat<br>This was something else again<br>I fear it cannot be explained<br>The words that make<br>The words that make murder<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?<br>What if I take my problem to the United Nations?</p>

    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Tell me when the world is ending<br>You won't be there, still pretending<br>I was just someone you would love to love<br>But never love<br>I know people without substance<br>Will fill themselves with substances<br>But then, honey child<br>There was us, there still is<br>I will come running<br>Gunning trough the years<br>Hunting heart<br>Crushing fear<br>I am still haunting down the roads<br>I know of the hell<br>That begs and burns below<br>Tell me how the stars exploded<br>Heaven caved in, earth corroded<br>I was still breaking my body in<br>When you first touched me<br>I know people will say<br>We've thrown our lives away<br>But is there a trail to salvation<br>Or salvation anyway<br>Their love laughs at locksmiths<br>We're smashing trough the windows<br>Of delicate dream homes<br>I feel so crowded alone<br>The empathy of breaking chains<br>The sympathy in crashing waves<br>Careful boy, caution girl<br>I do not think we were meant for this world<br>Forever haunted<br>By the roads I know<br>And if not above<br>I'll see you below</p>

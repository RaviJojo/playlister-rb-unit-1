    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>I heard that you’re settled down.<br>That you found a girl and you’re married now.<br>I heard that your dreams came true.<br>Guess she gave you things I didn’t give to you.<br><br>Old friend, why are you so shy?<br>Ain’t like you to hold back, or hide from the light.<br><br>I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,<br>But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it.<br>I had hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded<br>That for me, it isn’t over.<br><br>Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.<br>I wish nothing but the best for you too.<br>Don’t forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said:<br>“Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead”<br>Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead. Yeah.<br><br>You know how the time flies.<br>Only yesterday was the time of our lives.<br>We were born and raised in a summer haze.<br>Bound by the surprise of our glory days.<br><br>I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,<br>But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it.<br>I had hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded<br>That for me, it isn’t over.<br><br>Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.<br>I wish nothing but the best for you too.<br>Don’t forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said:<br>“Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead”.<br><br>Nothing compares, no worries or cares.<br>Regrets and mistakes; they’re memories made.<br>Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?<br><br>Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.<br>I wish nothing but the best for you.<br>Don’t forget me, I beg, I'll remembered you said:<br>“Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead”<br><br>Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.<br>I wish nothing but the best for you too.<br>Don’t forget me, I beg, I'll remembered you said:<br>“Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead”<br>Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead. Yeah.</p>

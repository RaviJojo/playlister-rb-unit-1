    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>You know I do my best thinking when I’m flying down the bridge.<br>Humming to myself and kicking up my kicks<br>..have to… for my life<br>I hope I won’t crush like another summer,<br>I’m back on the bridge was just a wooden half,<br>…like he said it was back in 56.<br>Chorus:<br>I thought I’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought he’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought you’d give me the right advice,<br>I thought he let me in for one last time.<br>…like an old time movie,<br>…she’s got kind of a native vibe before that was so cool<br>She’s got kind of a native vibe before I knew who was who<br>And he's ignoring me like it's 2001.<br>Why keep time travelling if it doesn’t get better on me?<br>A second time move on,<br>Why keep time travelling if it doesn’t get better on me?<br>A second time move on,<br>Chorus:<br>I thought I’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought he’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought you’d give me the right advice,<br>I thought he let me in for one last time.<br>..on another Sunday morning,<br>Carrying umbrella, and talking on the phone!<br>…cut my hand and my knees.<br>.. from California and I swear, I swear they’re here!<br>I swear they saved my life!<br>Chorus: (x2)<br>I thought I’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought he’d learnt from my mistakes,<br>I thought you’d give me the right advice,<br>I thought he let me in for one last time.</p>

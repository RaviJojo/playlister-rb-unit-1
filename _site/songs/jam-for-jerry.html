    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>You check the mirror, lock the door <br>You took the stairs downstairs from the third floor<br>You thought about her as you walked<br>Well did the sky open up above you in the dark<br><br>And what a note to leave with red (?)<br>Did you know what's coming or even half know it when you left<br><br>You set the tempo, set the pace<br>From the top, from the start, never slightly late<br>Just that afternoon we talked<br>Getting out, stepping out, let it out, something got caught<br><br>What about the time I heard you say<br>Were you only joking, or only half joking when you left <br><br>Chorus:<br><br>I get the feeling I've done<br>Something half wrong<br>It surrounds me, drowns me in it<br>If I could change it I would<br>If only I could<br>You can quote me, hold me to it<br><br>We dropped the records at the sea (?)<br>Writing numbers on our hands (?)<br>Called the cops, called the car<br>Call a friend, call a relative still in the dark <br><br>? in seconds flat<br>Call ahead to check in call ahead to ask them where they're at<br><br>Chorus (3X)</p>

    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Space is only noise if you can see<br>See I want to write a story about two long lines<br>Two pretty lines that fall in love<br>Two little spaces they're filled with echoes<br>Did the lines ever intersect one another, at a moment in time?<br>moment time"..<br> <br>have you always cross like this<br>have you always cross like this<br>have you been this way all the time<br>have you been this way all the time or were you always trying to get you with me?<br>with me? with me? with me?<br>you used to check the weather<br>now you stopped that<br>you used to look at time<br>now you stopped that<br>you used to wear red<br>now you wear white<br>what happens all the time it happens all the time<br>replace the word space with a drink and forget it<br>space is only noise if you can see.<br>grab a calculator and fix yourself<br>grab a calculator and fix yourself<br>read the news baby read the news<br>watch your clock baby watch your clock<br>watch the weather baby on tv<br>its all to get if you can see<br>grab a calculator and fix yourself<br>space is only noise if you can see<br>See I want to write a story about two long lines<br>Two pretty lines that fall in love<br>Two little spaces they're filled with echoes<br>Did the lines ever intersect one another, at a moment in time?<br>moment time"..</p>

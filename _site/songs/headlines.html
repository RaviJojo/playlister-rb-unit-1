    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>[Verse 1]<br>I might be too strung out on compliments<br>Overdosed on confidence<br>Started not to give a f-ck and stop fearing the consequence<br>Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments<br>Faded way too long I’m floating in and out of consciousness<br>And they sayin’ I’m back, I’d agree with that<br>I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that<br>I had someone tell me I fell off, ohh I needed that<br>And they wanna see me pick back up, well where’d I leave it at<br>I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that<br>Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I’m just mobbin’ like that<br>You know good and well that you don’t want a problem like that<br>You gone make someone around me catch a body like that<br>No don’t do it, please don’t do it, cause one of us goes in<br>And we all go through it<br>And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gone pay it<br>Those my brothers<br>[Chorus]<br>I ain’t even gotta say it<br>That’s just something they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>Yeah they know yeah<br>That the real is on the rise<br>F-ck them other guys<br>I even gave them a chance to decide<br>Now its something they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>Yeah I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.<br>Then she wanna ask when it got so empty<br>Tell her I apologize it happened over time<br>[Verse 2]<br>She says they missed the old drake, girl don’t tempt me<br>If they don’t get it, they’ll be over you<br>That new shit that you got is overdue<br>You better do what you suppose to do<br>I’m like why I gotta be all that but still I can’t deny the fact that it’s true<br>Listen to you expressing all them feelings<br>Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children<br>And that’s who you thinking is ’bout to come and make a killing<br>I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.<br>You know they aint even got it like that.<br>You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that<br>Cause I live for this it isn’t just a hobby like that.<br>When they get my shit and play it<br>[Chorus]<br>I ain’t even gotta say it<br>They know, they know, they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>Yeah they know yeah<br>That the real is on the rise<br>F-ck them other guys<br>I even gave them a chance to decide<br>Now its something they know<br>They know, they know, they know<br>I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind)<br>Tell em’ I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)</p>

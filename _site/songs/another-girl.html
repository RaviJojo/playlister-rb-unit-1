    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>People love it<br>When a beautiful woman self-destructs<br>Like a tiger in a cage or a bug under glass<br>People point but don't touch<br>But beautiful boys get away with so much<br>They get away with murder<br>They can be wasted and dirty and cruel<br>'Cause they know there's always another girl<br>And you want her, you want her, you want her<br>You really want her, oh, she's a mirage<br>In the desert she's like water<br>Boys geniuses can be ugly and fat<br>But they don't cut their girls any slack<br>Girls are advised to not think<br>About the future or the past<br>It matters not where they came from<br>Or whether or not they endure<br>What matters is if they can make all heads turn<br>'Cause there's always another girl<br>You want her, you want her, you want her<br>You really want her<br>You're hot and you're thirsty<br>And you're in the desert<br>And she's like water<br>She smiles until her face is petrified<br>And begins to crack<br>She wraps her hands in plastic bags at night<br>She wants to preserve what she has<br>And you want her, you want her, you want her<br>You really want her<br>You're hot and you're bothered and you're thirsty<br>And you're in the desert and she's like water<br>They pluck their hairs one by one<br>And stand on their heads, it's no fun<br>They cut their skin and it hurts to know<br>There's always another girl<br>Don't you love it<br>When a beautiful woman self-destructs?</p>

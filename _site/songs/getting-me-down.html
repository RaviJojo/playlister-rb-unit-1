    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>You try to make me fit<br>Your tiny four by four<br>It makes me sick<br>I?m claustrophobic<br>your perfect picture<br>Seen it all before<br>Smile and cash the check<br>Time is running out<br>It makes me tick<br>Tick toxic<br>That?s it, I quit<br>I?m getting really bored<br>Don?t dumb me down<br>Pink bubble gum<br>Forever young<br>This isn?t my idea of fun<br>I keep it loud<br>Get off my cloud<br>Don?t dumb me down<br>What you see for me<br>is everything<br>I never wanna be<br>A fake ID<br>A bit naive<br>Guess you know it all ?<br>Don?t dumb me down<br>Pink bubble gum<br>Forever young<br>This isn?t my idea of fun<br>I keep it loud<br>Get off my cloud<br>Don?t dumb me down<br>Sometimes you don?t get what you ask for<br>Sometimes you get a whole lot more.....</p>

    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me<br>Since you shipped my ass off to sea<br>I never knew where I was going<br>I went where the water was flowing<br>I know I've been gone a long time<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>I know I've been gone a long time<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>The ship was the love of my life<br>We went down together that night<br>I surfaced and married a shell<br>For years I just cruised on the run<br>I know I've been gone a long time<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>I know I've been gone a long time but<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>So don't try and fuck me about<br>The worst thing that happened was<br>I was standing too close to your heart<br>I'm tired and about to wake up<br>I know I've been gone a long time<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>I know I've been gone a long time but<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>Oh, I know I've been gone a long time but<br>I'm back and I want what is mine<br>I know I've been gone a long time<br>I'm back and I want what is mine</p>

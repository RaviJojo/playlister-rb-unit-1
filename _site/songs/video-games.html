    <p>Maybe we could go to Coney Island<br>Maybe I could sing the national anthem<br>Buy a white sweater for the last white day<br>Of the summer<br><br>Buy my purple wig<br>For my mermaid video<br>Walk back to where I live<br>In my motel<br>On Neptune Avenue.<br><br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off<br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off<br><br>Maybe we could go to<br>Sway/Suede(?) Tokyo<br>We'll see Van Halen at their re-union show.<br>Heavy metal hour on T.V.<br>Diamond Dave and Ray late<br>And you salute me, Miss America<br>Because I am, I am<br><br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off<br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off<br><br>Maybe we could go to Coney Island<br>Maybe I could sing you to sleep<br>God bless the universe, god bless the ocean<br>God bless you and god bless me<br>God bless you and god bless me<br><br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off<br>You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine<br>You say take it off, take it off</p>

They don't ever leave the coop<br><br>I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates<br>Serving all the fiends over there by the Golden Gate<br>Bridge, I'm colder than the fridge and the freezer<br>I'm snatching all your bitches at my leisure<br><br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br><br>And we stunting like Gucci Gucci, Louis, Louis, Fendi, Fendi, Prada<br>Them basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother<br>Gucci Gucci, Louis, Louis, Fendi, Fendi, Prada<br>Them basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother<br><br>Gucci, Gucci, Louis, Louis, Fendi, Fendi, Prada<br>I'm lookin' like Madonna but I'm flossin' like Ivana<br>Trump, you know I keep that work in my trunk<br>Got my hand on the pump if you wanna press your luck<br><br>I'm yelling free V-Nasty, till my throat is raspy<br>Young, rich and flashy I be where the cash be<br>You can't find that? I think you need a Google Map<br>My pearl handled kitty cat will leave and press your noodle back<br><br>Now Google that, groupies follow me like Twitter<br>I'm rolling up my catnip and shittin' in your litter<br>Why you lookin' bitter? I be lookin' better<br>The type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her<br><br>The editor, director, plus I'm my own boss<br>So posh, nails fierce with the gold gloss<br>Which means nobody getting over me<br>I got the swag and it's pumpin' out my ovaries<br><br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br>One big room full of bad bitches<br><br>And we stunting like Gucci Gucci, Louis, Louis, Fendi, Fendi, Prada<br>Them basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother<br>Gucci Gucci, Louis, Louis, Fendi, Fendi, Prada<br>Them basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother<br><br>Oh, all you basic ass hoes out there<br>Man, I got rooms full of bad bitches<br>They don't need Gucci, they don't need Louis<br>We swagging, ehh, meow</p>

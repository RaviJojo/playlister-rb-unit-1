    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"<br>You're laying waste to Halloween<br>You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street<br>You're in Milwaukee, off your feet<br>And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br>Strayed above the highway aisle<br>(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)<br>I could see for miles, miles, miles<br>3rd and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway<br>Was where we learned to celebrate<br>Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me<br>That night you played me 'Lip Parade'<br>Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree<br>Saying nothing, that's enough for me<br>And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br>Hulled far from the highway aisle<br>(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)<br>I could see for miles, miles, miles<br>Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright<br>Above my brother, I and tangled spines<br>We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be<br>Now to know it in my memory<br>And at once I knew I was not magnificent<br>High above the highway aisle<br>(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)<br>I could see for miles, miles, miles</p>

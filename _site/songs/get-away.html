    <p>Break it down and then break it up again<br>Me and my guitar drowning down and down<br>Not even the pain kicks in<br>Tell me when the pain kicks in<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Panoramic view, that's one thing I won't do<br>No shouted abuse from the corner of my mind<br>Not even the pain kicks in<br>Tell me when the pain kicks in<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Summer sun says get out more<br>I need you, I want you<br>But I can't get this feeling off my mind<br>I want you, I need you<br>I can't get away<br>I can't get away<br>I can't get away<br>Oh, I can't get away<br>Summer sun says get out more<br>I need you, I want you<br>But I can't get this feeling off my mind<br>I want you, I need you<br>Summer sun says get out more<br>I need you, I want you<br>But I can't get this feeling off my mind<br>I want you, I need you</p>

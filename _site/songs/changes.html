    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>Buffett Jimmy<br>Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>---------------------<br>by Jimmy Buffett<br><br><br>I took of for a weekend last month<br>just to try and recall the whole year<br>All of the faces and all of the places<br>just wonderin' where it all disappeared<br>But I didn't ponder the the question too long<br>I was hungry and went out for a bite<br>Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum<br>and I wound up drinkin' all night<br><br>Chorus:<br>It's those Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>Nothin' remains quite the same<br>with all of my running and all of my cunning<br>If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane<br><br>Reading departure signs in some big airport<br>reminds me of the places I've been<br>Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure <br>makes me want to go back again<br>If it suddenly ended tomorrow<br>I could somehow adjust to the fall<br>Good times and riches and son of a bitches<br>I've seen more than I can recall<br><br>2nd Chorus:<br>It's those Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>Nothin' remains quite the same<br>With all of the islands and all the highlands<br>If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane<br><br>I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine<br>and I wish I could jump on a plane<br>and so many nights I just I just dream on the ocean<br>God I wish I was sailin' again<br>Oh but yesterdays are over my shoulder<br>so I can't look back for too long<br>There's just too much at sea waiting in front of me<br>and I don't think I just can go wrong<br><br>Chorus:<br>It's those Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes<br>Nothin' remains quite the same<br>with all of my running and all of my cunning<br>If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane<br>If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane<br>If we weren't all crazy we would go insane</p>

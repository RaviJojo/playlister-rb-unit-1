    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>Don't keep it all in your head<br>What we had was off<br>It's best that we forget<br>And overlook it all<br>But even now<br>When they fall into place<br>I think about you then<br>I know I'd forget<br>If I was alone<br>Make sure I can mix<br>Love and hold on<br>Now I'm surrounded<br>By my old things<br>Thought I had moved on<br>Tried to make ends meet<br>But picked up a new beat<br>And so I lay out<br>But even now<br>When they fall into place<br>I think about 'em then<br>I know I'd forget<br>If I was alone<br>Make sure I can mix<br>Love and hold on<br>Make sure I can mix<br>Love and hold on<br>Make sure I can mix<br>Love and hold on<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget<br>Don't forget</p>

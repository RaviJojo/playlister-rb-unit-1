    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>You choke my throat<br>With words of wonder<br>You make it hard to breathe<br>Your love's so cold<br>Just like an arrow<br>Pierced through my skin I bleed<br><br>I knew you were no angel<br>But god, what did I do<br><br>Do you remember what I said<br>That first time we met<br>Stay away, why couldn't you stay away<br>I never needed anyone<br>But now that you are gone<br>Stay away, won't you just stay away<br><br>Taking all my light and blocking out my vision<br>Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison<br>On my hands on my knees pulled on the chains<br>Licking up the blood yeah I made this decision<br><br>You took my light<br>Trapped in the prison<br>You threw away the key<br>You are the curse<br>I am the captive<br>Walking on hands and knees<br>Never learn… never learn… never learn… never learn…<br><br>I knew you were no angel<br>But god you're just electric blue<br><br>Do you remember what I said<br>That first time we met,<br>Stay away, why couldn't you stay away<br>I never needed anyone<br>But now that you are gone<br>Stay away, won't you just stay away<br><br>Stay away, stay away, stay away…<br><br>I climbed a wall<br>To touch your shadow<br>I hear you call for me<br>But you're not there<br>You're just an echo<br>Why did you fall for me<br><br>Do you remember what I said<br>That first time we met,<br>Stay away, why couldn't you stay away<br>I never needed anyone<br>But now that you are gone<br>Stay away, won't you just stay away<br><br>Taking all my light and blocking out my vision<br>Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison<br>Stay away, why couldn't you stay away<br>Taking all my light and blocking out my vision<br>Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison<br>Stay away, won't you just stay away</p>

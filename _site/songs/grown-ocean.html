    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>In that dream I'm as old as the mountains<br>Still is starlight reflected in fountains<br>Children grown on the edge of the ocean<br>Kept like jewelry, kept with devotion<br>In that dream moving slow<br>Through the morning<br>You would come to me then without answers<br>Lick my wounds and remove my demands for now<br>Eucalyptus and orange trees are blooming<br>In that dream there's no darkness a-looming<br>In that dream moving slow<br>Through the morning time<br>In that dream I could hardly contain it<br>All my life I will wait to attain it<br>There, there, there<br>I know someday the smoke will all burn off<br>All these voices I'll someday have turned off<br>I will see you someday when I've woken<br>I'll be so happy just to have spoken<br>I'll have so much to tell you about it<br>In that dream I could hardly contain it<br>All my life I will wait to attain it<br>There, there, there<br>Wide-eyed walker, don't betray me<br>I will wake one day, don't delay me<br>Wide-eyed leaver, always going</p>

    <h3>The Lyrics</h3>
    <p>It's never easy to say goodbye*<br>To the faces<br>So rarely do we see another one<br>So close and so long<br>I asked the room if I'd said enough<br>No one really answered<br>They just said, "Don't go, don't go"<br>Well all this leaving is neverending<br>I kept hoping for one more question<br>Or for someone to say,<br>"Who do you think you are?"<br>So I could tell them<br>With intensity, the drop evaporates by law<br>In conclusion, leaving is easy<br>When you've got some place you need to be<br>I'm giving up this gig for another seaon<br>With the TV on mute<br>I'm listening back to the tapes<br>On the hotel bed<br>My my my apocalypse<br>I realized I had said very little about ways or wheels<br>Or riding for the feeling<br>Riding for the feeling<br>Is the fastest way to reach the shore<br>On water or land<br>Riding for the feeling<br>What if I had stood there at the end<br>And said again and again and again and again and again<br>An answer to every question<br>Riding for the feeling<br>Would that have been a suitable goodbye?</p>

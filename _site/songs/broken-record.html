    <h3>The lyrics</h3>
    <p>I would toss some time at night with your voice in my head<br>Like a broken record all the words you say<br>And when I finally fall asleep you find your way into my dreams<br>But I would never mind, you see, 'cause I get to live my fantasy<br>And I know though we're made our mistakes<br>But you're holding every breath I take<br>Feeling this is more than fate<br>So please don't let me go, my baby<br>And I know though we're made our mistakes<br>But you're holding every breath I take<br>Feeling this is more than fate<br>So please don't let me go, my baby<br>I try my best to get away from you so badly<br>Knowing that I'd give my heart to you so gladly<br>But then it came, reality, every word of when she came to me<br>But now I gave myself to you, I'm so scared of what you're gonna do<br>And I know though we're made our mistakes<br>But you're holding every breath I take<br>Feeling this is more than fate<br>So please don't let me go, my baby<br>And I know though we're made our mistakes<br>But you're holding every breath I take<br>Feeling this is more than fate<br>So please don't let me go, my baby<br>Keep your arms exactly where they are<br>I wanna be here, I wanna feel you<br>And I keep my thoughts exactly where you are<br>I wanna be here, I wanna feel you<br>Like a broken record<br>Like a broken record<br>Like a broken record<br>Like a broken record</p>
